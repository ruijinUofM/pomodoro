## Project Aim
The aim of the project was to make a website with a timer that corresponded with the
"pomodoro technique" for studying and working. The website has an about page with some information
and then a timer page that contains the actual timer. The timer has a work mode and a break mode.
When the timer is running, a tomato image should start animating based on the mode.
If the timer is on work mode then the tomato will turn from yellow
to red throughout the duration of the timer's run. If the timer is on the break mode
then the tomato will grow from the stem throughout the duration of the timer.
If paused, the tomato drops down and starts over when unpaused with the new set time as its duration.
## About this project
This project was my first project with javascript, html, and 
css and took me about a week.
Some interesting things I was able to do included learning to use 
pseudo-classes and flexboxes for css. I was also able to make css animations 
and time them with events in javascript.
Additionally, I used web workers for the timer to learn about basic multithreading.
