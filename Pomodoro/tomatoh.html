        <h3> the technique </h3>
        <p> The <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique>pomodoro technique</a>
          is a useful strategy for working created by Francesco Cirillo about thirty years ago.
          The strategy consists of intervals of working and breaks. Inspired by the tomato-shaped
          timer Cirillo had, each interval is called a "pomodoro", Italian for the red vegetable.
        </p>
        <h3> how it works </h3>
        <p> The technique allows a period of work that usually ranges from a twenty to twenty-five
          minutes, followed by a short break. The break typically lasts about three to five minutes.
          After four periods of work, or "pomodoros", there's a longer break that lasts about fifteen
          to twenty minutes.
        </p>
        <h3> timer instructions </h3>
        <p> It should be rather self explanatory, but the timer values along with the pomodoro value
          can be changed when the timer is paused. The "start/pause" and "work" buttons can be pressed.
          The "start/pause" button controls the timer and the "work" button toggles between whether the
          user should be working or resting. The tomato itself will grow, ripen or fall depending on the
          state of the timer. </p>

        <h3> about this project </h3>
        <p> My name is Rui Jin, and I am currently a student in the University of Michigan.
          <a href = "https://github.com/ruijinUofM/pomodoro"> You can find my github here.</a> This was my
          first attempt at making a website. The resources I learned from were <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/">
          w3schools.com</a>, <a href = "https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks.com</a>, and
          <a href = "https://internetingishard.com/"> internetingishard.com</a>, along with a
          few tips from stack exchange. I also used an <a href = "https://editor.method.ac/">
          online svg editor </a> to get the stem of the tomato on the timer page. The font you're reading right now
          is the light version of lato from google fonts. Anyway, thank you for checking this out!
